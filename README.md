- Connects to MySQL DB
- Produces XML Schema (XSD)
- Produces XML (Data)
- User can edit xsd:datatypes from JXTreeTable before serializing
- User can edit serialised XML before saving

-
- EXTRA stuff....
- ALT+Scroll =  changes font size
- Scroll = scrolls text
- color coded text

-
- NEXT on the Agenda... (beginning now, and probably in this order)
- program produces RDF and OWL
- program connects to Oracle DBs
- program loads XML/XSD (and can consequently be translated into RDF/OWL)
- program connects to Apache TDB and "inserts" RDF
- CODE will be merged from JohnG79/RDB2OWL repo.

Projected finish date of complete prototype: Feb 29 2016.


Development has been on hold since November 2015 for research purposes 
( OWL, DL, conversion from RDB to ontologies, ... )
